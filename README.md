Air pollution is a serious environmental and public health concern affecting people all over the world. With growing industrialization, urbanization, and increased mobility in many places, pollutant emissions into the atmosphere have surged, posing serious threats to human health, ecosystems, and the global climate. The purpose of this paper is to analyses and interpret worldwide air pollution trends using data from a variety of sources. We aim to provide insights into the global distribution, trends, and correlations of air pollution indicators using visualizations such as scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and heat maps.
